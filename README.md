# PayNTrack: Expense Manager + Payment App (Demo)

Welcome to **PayNTrack**, a smart payment and expense tracking application built using **Flutter (frontend)**, **Flask (backend)**, and **PostgreSQL (database)**. This app is designed to enhance the core functionality of everyday payment apps by introducing **automatic expense categorization** and smart budgeting features.

## 💡 Problem Statement

As a student with a fixed monthly allowance and regular usage of payment apps like GPay, I noticed a major gap: while GPay supports transactions and bill splitting, it lacks **personalized insights** into spending behavior. There is no smart categorization or detailed monthly breakdown of expenses. That’s where **PayNTrack** comes in.
